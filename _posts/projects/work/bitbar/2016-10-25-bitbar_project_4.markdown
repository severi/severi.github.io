I created an image recognition library for mobile test automation out of an existing sample project. The motivation was to extract the actual image recognition logic that was previously hard wired into a Java-based test automation project sample (<https://github.com/bitbar/testdroid-samples/tree/master/image-recognition>). 

The library can now also be utilized with frameworks such as Robot Framework and it's not anymore dependent on the usage of Appium which makes its usage more flexible.
