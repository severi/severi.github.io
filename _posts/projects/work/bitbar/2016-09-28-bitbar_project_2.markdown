Created a simple example for utilizing Cucumber with Testdroid Cloud. Created based on an existing Java example (<https://github.com/bitbar/testdroid-samples/tree/c39e3f3b2bd648295dcbaa2c0ffc19c469e26c7c/appium/sample-scripts/java>). The example can be both run client-side on the user's local machine against Testdroid Cloud and server-side directly in Testdroid Cloud.
