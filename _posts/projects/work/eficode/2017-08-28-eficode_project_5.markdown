Implemented a new version for customer's mobile testing cloud. The previous version had been implemented purely on Jenkins in the form of freestyle jobs. For the new version I implemented a UI which visualized the different test projects and statuses of the phones connected to the system. The backend was implemented using Python and Django framework. In addition, we created shared libraries for Jenkins which allow the usage of the mobile testing cloud using Jenkins Pipelines. The software was run on Openshift Container Platform.
