I worked as a Scrum Master on a project made for a finnish IT company together with 6 B.Sc. Students as part of a course for Aalto University. Besides ordinary Scrum Master tasks my responsibilities included team leading, setting up the technology stack for the project and supporting the rest of the team to get the project up and running smoothly. In addition I set up a CI environment using Jenkins and Docker.
