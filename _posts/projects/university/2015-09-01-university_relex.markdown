I am working as a Scrum Master on a project made for a finnish IT company together with 6 younger BSc students from Aalto University. Besides ordinary Scrum Master tasks my responsibilities include team leading, setting up the technology stack for the project and supporting the rest of the team to get the project up and running smoothly. In addition I have set up a CI environment using Jenkins and Docker.
