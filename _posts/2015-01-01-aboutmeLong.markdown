Hi there!

I'm a SW Developer and DevOps enthusiast from Finland with international work background currently pursuing my M.Sc. Degree at Aalto University.
I enjoy working together with other people on interesting projects and I have a high interest in improving my knowledge and learn new - both technical and non-technical - skills. Being a people person I enjoy meeting new people from diverse backgrounds and hopefully meet good future friends aswell! Besides tech related stuff I enjoy doing sports and at the late (or early) hours sing few songs at karaoke. My friends depict me as a person who likes to make things happen. For example this text has been written during a portfolio hackathon which I organized with my friends.
